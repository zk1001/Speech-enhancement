% SIMULATION
% 
% The system can be simulated once the Plant Identification and the
% Controller Training are complete. After you select the Apply buttons in
% either window, you can simulate the plant. Go back to the Simulink
% window and select Start under the Simulation menu to start the simulation. 
% If the performance is not satisfactory, you can go back to retrain the controller.
